✨ This is built using Python 3

✨ To run this program:

  - Download the file to your computer;
  - Open a Python editor (Pycharm, VSCode, etc..);
  - Open the file that is downloaded on your computer;
  - Run the program inside your IDE
  - Your camera should be open, and you're ready to go!

✨ Future Ideas:

  - Add a GUI and make it user interactive
  - Have the app hosted 
  - Add other features, i.e. hand movements.

✨ Purpose:

  - To open the users camera and track their eye movements, which are replaced of their actual computers mouse.

✨ How effective? 

  - Because it allowed people who don't have access to a mouse, or who are unable to use one,
  to actually be able to use a computer in just simple eye movements, supported by MediaPipe framework, built into Python by Google.
